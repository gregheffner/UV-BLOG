# UV Blog Demo

This repository supports a blog write-up comparing traditional Python dependency and environment management tools (pip, venv) with the new UV tool from Astral.

## Purpose

The examples and folders here are designed to showcase the workflow and speed differences between:
- pip + venv
- UV (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

You will find:
- Example scripts importing multiple packages
- API server demos
- Step-by-step instructions for running with both pip/venv and UV
